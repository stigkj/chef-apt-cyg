Good luck with that..._\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nI am not saying you cannot use chef under Windows. It is just that Windows lacks a package manager, which makes\r\ninstalling/uninstalling/dependency handling under chef way more difficult than anyone in their right mind would deal\r\nwith. I know, I know, there are someone trying [to][1] [rectify][2] [that][3], but until that has gone through a _few_\r\nmore iterations we are left with nada. Or are we?\r\n\r\nThere is an excellent project called Cygwin that let you have quite a complete Unix/Posix environment under Windows.\r\nAnd as it happens it has a decent package manager that has the features we like, with install/uninstall actions,\r\ndependency handling and more.\r\n\r\nThe only problem is that this package manager is a GUI application which makes it unfit for our purpose. As luck will\r\nhave it, there is an _excellent_ command line package manager called [apt-cyg][4] which _do_ fit our purpose.\r\n\r\nSo, by utilizing `apt-cyg`, chef-apt-cyg makes it easy to install packages under Cygwin. Or wouldn't you say so:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\npackage \"git\" do\r\n  action :install\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\n\r\n### High-level steps\r\n\r\nThese are the high-level steps to get a Windows machine ready for using chef-apt-cyg:\r\n\r\n1. Download and install Cygwin (obviously)\r\n2. Install additional packages needed by chef\r\n    * make\r\n    * gcc-core\r\n    * wget\r\n    * ruby\r\n3. Install RubyGems\r\n4. Install chef with related tools\r\n\r\n### Automated install\r\n\r\nInstead of doing this manually, most of these are automated. Just follow these steps:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new directory or use an existing as long as it is empty<br>\r\n  **NB!** cannot be the same directory as Cygwin is installed into\r\n2. Download the following files into this directory\r\n    * [install-cygwin-chef-and-apt-cyg.cmd](install-cygwin-chef-and-apt-cyg.cmd)\r\n    * [Cygwin's setup.exe][5]\r\n    * client.rb and validation.pem (from your chef-server installation)\r\n3. Open cmd.exe in this directory\r\n4. Start install-cygwin-chef-and-apt-cyg.cmd\r\n\r\nWhen the script is finished, you will have a new/updated installation of Cygwin under c:\\cygwin, or whatever\r\ndirectory you specified.\r\n\r\nFor more information look at the [Installation on Windows][6] walk through on Opscode's wiki. Just remember that you\r\nshould **not** install RubyInstaller/RubyInstaller DevKit for Windows as this won't work properly under Cygwin.\r\n\r\nAttributes\r\n----------\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nJust make sure that this cookbook is selected before you start installing packages. You can add:\r\n\r\n  include_recipe 'apt-cyg'\r\n\r\nto all your recipes that install packages, or you can just make sure it's on the run list somewhere early on.\r\nThe cookbook itself ensures that apt-cyg is installed and up to date.\r\n\r\nLicense and Author\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n**Author:** Stig Kleppe-Jørgensen (<from-chef-apt-cyg@nisgits.net>)<br>\r\n**Copyright:** 2011-, Stig Kleppe-Jørgensen\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\nlimitations under the License.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]: http://coapp.org\r\n[2]: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey\r\n[3]: http://code.google.com/p/windows-package-manager\r\n[4]: http://code.google.com/p/apt-cyg\r\n[5]: http://cygwin.org/setup.exe\r\n[6]: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Installation+on+Windows\r\n\r\n","tagline":"Chef cookbook for installing and configuring apt-cyg to be used as a package manager under Cygwin","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
